# CISC372-Assignment-1-Remembering-C
CISC372 Programming Assingnment #1
Overview:
In this assignment, we will be working with the c language to write a serial (not parallel) program to re-
familiarize ourselves with c programs, and compiling them via the unix operating system using gcc. You
are to build a simple C program that implements a matrix (2d array) in two different ways, and then
prints the matrix transposed (i.e. rows become columns, columns become rows). You should implement
this as 2 functions (1 for each storage method) with a main function that simply calls the two functions
that will do the work.
